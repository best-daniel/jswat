## Java Debugger ##

JSwat is a graphical Java debugger front-end, written to use the Java
Platform Debugger Architecture and based on the NetBeans Platform. Its
features include sophisticated breakpoints; colorized source code display
with code navigator; movable display panels showing threads, call stack,
visible variables, and loaded classes; command interface for more advanced
features; and Java-like expression evaluation, including method invocation.

## Discontinued ##

This project is effectively discontinued as of 2013. It is known _not_ to work with Java 8 and possibly even Java 7. No one is working on this project any more, including the original author. May I humbly suggest using one of the much better alternatives?

## Downloads ##

The compiled binaries and installers for milestone releases are available from
Google Drive: [JSwat Downloads](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8-CbCFlTA3nOVhZREhIcXBvT2c&usp=sharing)

The `-cli` files are special versions of JSwat compiled for use on a text-
based console. The other files should be self-evident: installers for the
various platforms, and zip files for those where an installer is not
available or desirable. Source for each release is available from the
Releases page, and via tags in the source repository.

## Getting Help ##

Asking for help is as easy as posting a message to the
[jswat-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jswat-discuss) Google
Group. Be sure to read the README file that is included with JSwat, the
troubleshooting section of the Installation instructions, as well as any
pertinent help topics, before asking questions.
